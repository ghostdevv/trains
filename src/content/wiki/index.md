# trains.willow.sh

A collection of tools + wiki for british train nerdery.

## Tools

The website in general is optimised for mobile, and for bad connections - like those on trains!

### Live Train Times

[/tools/live-trains](/tools/live-trains)

Based on the [realtimetrains](https://www.realtimetrains.co.uk) API, this provides live train times in a single table. The crucial difference, ignoring the lack of features compared to RTT, is that the train class numbers (where possible) are displayed in the table. This is so you can quickly see all the different trains at a station.

### Train Lookup

[/tools/train-lookup](/tools/train-lookup)

This effectively wraps the Wikipedia API to focus on train lookups, and attempts to present that info in a nice way.

### Station Lookup

[/tools/station-lookup](/tools/station-lookup)

This tool allows you to lookup a station by it's name, crs, or tiploc code.
